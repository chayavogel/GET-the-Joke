# Phase-1-Project
This is an application for displaying jokes. When the page loads, a list of ten jokes on the topic of programming are displayed by default.
There are also two buttons that enable the user to select the topic of jokes that they would like displayed (general, and programming). Clicking on either will load a list of ten new jokes, as well as any jokes that had been submitted on that topic.
There is also a joke submission feature enabling the user to submit and render their own jokes.

# Visuals
These buttons enable the user to select the topic of the jokes they would like to view:
